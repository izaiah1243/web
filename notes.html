    Dear Tara Templeton this note did start with me listing everything I love about you but I quickly realised I would be here for eternity if I did that because there are so many reasons. You have no idea how happy you make me and how much I love you I don’t even know where to start because there aren’t enough words in the world to show how much I love you the moment you came into my life, everything changed in the best way possible. You make me feel so positive and make me feel like the luckiest person alive just to be with you. Every time I look at you, I feel grateful I love the way you laugh, the way your eyes light up and the way you just being with me makes everything feel perfect like every time you send me a message I still get so excited. I love you so much I miss you like the second we are away from each other I really hope I don’t sound crazy right now but it is true. You are so perfect I need you to know how incredibly beautiful you are and you have no idea how happy it makes me that you are starting to see how beautiful you are because you are genuinely perfect like today when I saw you look in the mirror and finally see how beautiful and perfect you are that made me so fucking happy (I just read over this and it doesn’t make sense this was when we were having a shower in the morning when I had to go to work) you make me so happy happier than I ever thought I could be i am going to make sure I make you happy every single day second of every single day. Remember you are genuinely like beyond beautiful like I said today you are so perfect and so beautiful I always want you to remember that you complete me and make my life perfect you are all I ever dreamed of in someone and an infinite times more. I love you so fucking much and trust me when I say I love you most my beautiful future wife my star my Tara Templeton.

    My love
    I can’t begin to tell you how grateful I am for you. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. You are the most kind, most caring, and most beautiful person on the planet. I can’t even begin to say how beautiful you are.
    Don’t even get me started on that smile OH MY that is my smile. I love you so so so so so much. Like I will actually do anything for you. I hope you know that when I tell you that you are beautiful, my love, I mean it. I mean every word I say to you. I have never lied to you. You are genuinely the most beautiful, most gorgeous, most pretty girl in the universe. I actually feel so lucky to have you. Like, the fact that you are with me actually shocks me. I don't know how I have you, but I am never going to lose you.
    The way your eyes look when you smile actually makes me feel so warm inside. That sounds cheesy, but it is true—like I don't know how to explain it any other way. You are just so perfect. I don't even know how you are real. Like are you actually real, or am I just dreaming Like, no fucking way you are real let alone you are with me.
    You make me feel so special and loved. I have never felt that before, so thank you so so so much. All I want to do is make you happy and make you feel loved and make you see how beautiful you are. I want you to read this if you ever have any silly thoughts MY LOVE DON'T BE SILLYYYYYYY. You are genuinely the most beautiful girl in the universe, like I said. You are the first person I was actually attracted to, and that was scary because I had all these feelings that I had never had before. Like, that’s how beautiful and hot and sexy and pretty you are, my beautiful wife.
    Genuinely, thank you for being with me. You are my everything. You make me get up every day. You are the most perfect person in the universe. Like, genuinely, you should be studied because I don't know how it is possible for someone to be so perfect. I mean everything I say, my love.
    
    I love you so so so so so much.
    I love you more than anything.
    I genuinely love you most, my beautiful wife.
    
    I LOVE YOU MOST
